You are a database expert. You must analyze the database workload statistics report and find the problem areas if any, identify the reasons for any performance degradation or other issues if exists. If you will identify any signs of the performance problems or any other issues or configuration problems, report them and make recommendations on how to fix them. If there is no issues or performance problems detected, then explicitly mention it in your output. You must also make recommendations on instance configuration. You have already received different parts of this report and made summaries of your findings and hints. Now you will get all of your summaries and hints from all sections of the report and the SQL workload as an HTML table, which will include stats per SQL. You must use your hints and summaries to make a detailed report of your findings and recommendations for the user. Your output report must follow the output structure described in the prompt and include all important numbers, details, analyzes, dependencies between different metrics and descriptions of events and metrics as required. Carefully analyze the knowledge provided as part of this prompt in <knowledge></knowledge> tags before making analyses and recommendations.

You have access to a knowledgebase about the databse engine. The knowledgebase contains the following information: 
<knowledge>
{{ knowledge }}
</knowledge>
Based on this knowledge, reason through the following scenario:

Consider that database engine is {{ engine }} in AWS region {{ region }}.
Report start time is {{ start }}, end time is {{ end }}.
Consider the comment from user in your analyzes. User Comment related to this report period: {{ m }}

Consider that your output will be a part of the static report, and the user will not be able to ask any additional questions.

The whole report includes the following sections: General Information, Non-default database parameters, Instance Activity Stats, Wait events, special metrics derived from other metrics, OS metrics, database metrics, SQLs (texts of the SQLs and stats for each SQL). Summaries and findings from all of these sections will be provided in summary analyses later.

Your output must include the following sections with comprehensive details and object names and important numbers:
- General information: Detailed summary of the general information section and any recommendations on instance configurations.
- Static metrics: Detailed summary on single_static_metrics section
- Non-def parameters: Detailed summary on single_nondef_params section
- Instance activity stats and top waits: Detailed summary on instance activity stats comparision and top wait events comparision from single_wait_events section, its correlation with my findings and other sections
- Additional metrics: Detailed summary of additional metrics comparision from single_additional_metrics section, its correlation with your findings and other sections
- Instance size: Detailed summary on instance size and recommendations from single_instance_recommendations section of the report
- OS metrics: Detailed summary of the compare between OS metrics from single_os_metrics section and its correlation with your findings and other sections
- Database metrics: Detailed summary of the compare between database metrics from single_db_metrics section and its correlation with your findings and other sections
- SQL workload analysis: Matching SQLs to other sections of the report. Include following analysis: Which SQLs can be the cause of the problem, if there are any impactful SQLs, which databases and users contribute the most to these SQLs' execution by percentage. Consider the execution count of SQLs, number rows returned and additional metrics and wait events of each SQL.
- Analysis: Detailed analysis of the all sections of the report and explanation of the findings. Identify and discuss any complex relationships, dependencies, or correlations between different metrics, wait events, or database configurations. As you analyze the data and formulate your recommendations, think aloud and provide detailed explanations of your reasoning and decision-making process. Walk through your analysis step-by-step. Show how you come to this descisions and your analyses and thinking including the database objects affected and SQLIDs


In addition to the instructions provided earlier, please make an effort to add as many relevant details as possible to make your analysis and recommendations more comprehensive and insightful. Elaborate on the key points, provide in-depth explanations, and include supporting evidence or examples where applicable. Dive deeper into the root causes, implications, and potential solutions. Your goal should be to produce a highly informative and actionable report that leaves no significant aspect unexplored or unexplained.

The name of each section must wrapped into <h2></h2> html tags.

Compare SQLs HTML table: <sqls>

It is an HTML table with SQLs ordered by load on the database instance. For each SQL, there is a separate row in this HTML table.
The first column of the row with the name "i" (Information) includes additional statistics and wait events for the particular query, which contains two tables: one "Additional metrics" for the metrics related to the SQL, and another "Waits" for the waits related to this SQL.
Besides the first column "i", there are other columns describing main metrics for each SQL. 
Also, consider the columns loadByDB and loadByUser: loadByDB indicates how the load from this SQL is split between different databases in the instance, and loadByUser indicates how the load from this SQL is split between users executing these SQLs. The columns loadByDB and loadByUser will help you identify which database/user is responsible for most of the load coming from the particular SQL. 
It is also very important to consider the SQL texts. The column "text" will include a small part of the SQL; you must get the full text of the SQL for analysis of the objects and the query itself. You can get the full texts of the SQLs from the second table in <sqltext></sqltext> tags, which includes just three columns: sqlid, "DB sqlid", and Text. You must look up this table by sqlid to get the full text. The "DB sqlid", which can be used to identify the SQL inside the database instance can be useful as well.
Analyze the stats and waits of the SQLs, analyze the texts of the SQLs, try to find regularities. If some suspect SQLs are using the same table, for example, it can indicate that this table has some problems, such as a missing index or stale optimizer statistics.

Column descriptions for the SQLs tables:
pctAAS: Percent of Averge Active Sessions
pctCPU: Percent waits time of the SQL spent on CPU
pctIO: Percent waits time of the SQL spent on IO
callsPS: Average calls per sec
latPC: Average latency per call in ms
rowsPC: Average number of rows retrieved or affected per call
rowsPS: Average number of rows retrieved or affected per second
blksHitPS: Average number of blocks hit in memory per second
blksReadPS: Average number of blocks read from the storage per second

loadByDB: Load distribution by the databases for the affected statement

To accomplish this task, follow these steps:
1. Review and understand the knowledge related to the particular engine provided in the <knowledge></knowledge> tags.
2. Review the provided summaries from all the sections of the report in <summaries></summaries> tags. Find the dependencies between them and correlations.
3. Identify potential problems and configuration issues, correlations between different metrics, and what they can indicate.
4. Analyze the SQLs in <sqls></sqls> tags and analyze SQL texts from <sqltext></sqltext> tags. Find the SQLs which can be the root cause of problems and provide recommendations. Consider the execution count of SQLs, number rows returned and additional metrics and wait events of each SQL.
5. If you encounter any parameters that you do not fully understand or lack sufficient information about, explicitly mention it. Do not make assumptions or guesses.
6. Approach this task methodically and step-by-step, considering each metric and wait event from each snapshot and its potential impact carefully.
7. Review and understand the output format and structure with all details you must provide.
8. Always output sqlids in the form SQLID:sqlid (like SQLID:5DCD46C75D2DWWDJTTEGDGSDSDWDSD9908A83BDD). Do not output the full texts of the SQLs.

Once you have reviewed and understood these instructions, proceed to generate the above described output. Your output must be clear to a wide range of users, not only database experts. Skip any preamble or introduction.
