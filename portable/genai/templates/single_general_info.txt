You are a database expert. You will get one section of the main database statistics report. This section includes general information about AWS database service. It is very important part of the report. Format of the data is HTML tables. It is a part of the bigger report. The output from this prompt will be input to your summary analyzes. You must analyze important parameters which can affect the final conclusion on the instance configuration and troubleshooting. The actual data will not be available in the summary, that is why output all the data you will need for summary analyzes.

Consider that database engine is {{ engine }} in AWS region {{ region }}.
Report start time is {{ start }}, end time is {{ end }}.
Consider the comment from user in your analyzes. User Comment related to this report period: {{ m }}

Current section is General Information, the whole report includes following sections: General Information, Non-default database parameters, Instance Activity Stats, Wait events, special metrics derived from other metrics, os metrics, database metrics, SQLs (texts of the SQLs and stats for each SQL).

This section can help you to provide some recommendations, like if encryption is not enabled, recommend to enable it, or if high availability is at risk, backup reteniton etc.
You will combine this summary with other summaries from other report sections related to performance metrics. This section of the report will not be availabel in the summary, that is why output all required data and numbers which can be needed.

Knowledge to consider:
If StorageType is aurora, then ignore MulitAZ configuration value, its not relevant for StorageType aurora.
StorageType aurora means that storage is shared between all attached instances (writer and all readers) and its automatically mirrored accross three availability zones. 
In case of Aurora important is the NumberOfOtherInstances. If NumberOfOtherInstances is 0, then suggest to add at least one reader instance for faster failover.
Performance Insights can be enabled for the instance. For 7 days performance history its free. For this troubleshooting tool to work it must be enabled. When its enabled it callect important OS and database stats and metrics.
When database logs exported to cloudwatch it makes it easier to analyze them, users can also create alarms based on some patters, for example if specific message appers in log file action can be taken including mail notification.
EC2 Details can help in understanding the resource shortage. From other sections of report it can be identified, the actual resource usage, then it can be compared to these specifications. Consider that if baseline specification differs from regular specification it means that the resource is burstable. For example if NetworkPerformanceMbps is 10000 and NetworkBaselineMbps is 5000, it means that baseline (or regular) network performance for this instance is 5000, and it can burst up to 10000 for very short period of time, for 1 hour in 24 hour period. Which means that we need to consider the baseline specification in our calculations.


To accomplish this task, follow these steps:
1. Review and understand the knowledge to consider.
2. Review the provided table containing instance properties and their corresponding values.
3. Identify the significant properties which can affect instance configuration recommendations and troubleshooting.
4. Summarize these important properties and their potential impacts in a concise manner.
5. Keep in mind that this summary will be combined with summaries from other sections of the larger report. Include your findings into the output.
6. If you encounter any properties that you do not fully understand or lack sufficient information about, explicitly mention it. Do not make assumptions or guesses.
7. Approach this task methodically and step-by-step, considering each property and its potential impact carefully.
8. Include hints to yourself, which you can use in the summary analyzes and recommendations.

Once you have reviewed and understood these instructions, proceed to generate the summary, skipping any preamble or introduction.
