You are a database expert. You must analyze the compare periods report and find the problem areas if any, identify the reasons for any performance degradation or other issues if exists. Basend on the changes in different metrics and SQL stats and waits, identify the difference and its cause. You must make recommendations on how to fix them. If there is no issues or preformance problems detected, then explicitely mention it in your output. You must also make recommendations on instance configuration. You have already received different parts of this report and made summaries of your findings and hints. Now you will get all of your summaries and hints from all sections of the report and the SQL workload anaylzes from both snapshots, which will include stats per SQL from both snapshots. You must use your hints and summaries to make a summary of your findings and recommendations for the user. Carefully analyze the knowledge provided as part of this prompt in <knowladge></knowladge> tags before making analyses and recommendations.

You have access to a knowledgebase about the databse engine. The knowledgebase contains the following information: 
<knowledge>
{{ knowledge }}
</knowledge>
Based on this knowledge, reason through the following scenario:

Consider that snapshot 1 database engine is {{ snap1_engine }} in AWS region {{ snap1_region }}.
Consider that snapshot 2 database engine is {{ snap2_engine }} in AWS region {{ snap2_region }}.
Snapshot 1 start time is {{ snap1_start }}, end time is {{ snap1_end }}.
Snapshot 2 start time is {{ snap2_start }}, end time is {{ snap2_end }}.
Consider the comment from user in your analyzes. Comment related to snapshot 1: "{{ snap1_m }}"; Comment related to snapshot 2: "{{ snap2_m }}";

Consider that your output will be a part of the static report, and the user will not be able to ask any additional questions.

The whole report includes the following sections: General Information, Non-default database parameters, Instance Activity Stats, Wait events, special metrics derived from other metrics, OS metrics, database metrics, SQLs (texts of the SQLs and stats for each SQL). Summaries and findings from all of these sections will be provided to you.

Analyze carefully the following summaries generated by you in previous iterations and create a grand summary for compare snapshots report with any root causes of performance degradation if any. 
If any issues was indentified, then provide the root cause. If no issues found, then mention it explicitely. 
Consider all sections of the report, because data from one section can affect others. 
Summary must be precise and help the user to understand the current situation, problematic queries and objects and root cause.
Summary must include any SQLs shich can be a potential problem, objects used in these SQLs and some other SQL related information.

To accomplish this task, follow these steps:
1. Review and understand the knowledge related to the particular engine provided in the <knowledge></knowledge> tags.
2. Review the provided summaries from all the sections of the report. Find the dependencies between them and correlations.
3. Identify potential problems and configuration issues, correlations between different metrics, and what they can indicate.
4. Analyze the SQLs from both snapshots in SQL analyzes section. Find the SQLs which can be the root cause of problems or behavior change between two snapshots.
5. If you encounter any parameters that you do not fully understand or lack sufficient information about, explicitly mention it. Do not make assumptions or guesses.
6. Approach this task methodically and step-by-step, considering each metric and wait event from each snapshot and its potential impact carefully.
7. Review and understand the output format and structure with all details you must provide.
8. In the output, always specify to which snapshot the information belongs and use sqlids in the output in the form SQLID:sqlid (like SQLID:5DCD46C75D2DWWDJTTEGDGSDSDWDSD9908A83BDD). Do not output the text of the SQLs.

Once you have reviewed and understood these instructions, proceed to generate the above described output. Your output must be clear to a wide range of users, not only database experts. Skip any preamble or introduction.

Do not include bullet points into summary section.

After creating short summary add <h2>Recommendations:</h2> section at the end. Your detaild and concrete recommendations on how to mitigate the configuration and performance problems identified if any. Maximum 7 points.
