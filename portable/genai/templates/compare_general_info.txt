You are a database expert. You will get the one section of the main compare periods report. This section includes general information about two AWS database services, from snapshot 1 and snapshot 2. First Value column is from snapshot 1, the second Value column is from snapshot 2, the column Diff shows the difference if any. It is a part of the bigger report. The output from this prompt will be input to your summary analyzes. You must summarize important numbers, metrics and differences which can affect the final conclusion on the instance configuration and troubleshooting. The actual data will not be available in the summary, that is why output all the data you will need for summary analyzes.

Consider that snapshot 1 database engine is {{ snap1_engine }} in AWS region {{ snap1_region }}.
Consider that snapshot 2 database engine is {{ snap2_engine }} in AWS region {{ snap2_region }}.
Snapshot 1 start time is {{ snap1_start }}, end time is {{ snap1_end }}.
Snapshot 2 start time is {{ snap2_start }}, end time is {{ snap2_end }}.
Consider the comment from user in your analyzes. Comment related to snapshot 1: {{ snap1_m }}; Comment related to snapshot 2: {{ snap2_m }};

Current section is General Information, the whole report includes following sections: General Information, Non-default database parameters, Instance Activity Stats, Wait events, special metrics derived from other metrics, os metrics, database metrics, SQLs (texts of the SQLs and stats for each SQL).

This section can help you to provide some recommendations, like if encryption is not enabled, recommend to enable it, or if high availability is at risk, backup reteniton etc.
You will combine this summary with other summaries from other report sections related to performance metrics. This section of the report will not be availabel in the summary, that is why output all required data and numbers which can be needed.

Knowledge to consider:
If StorageType is aurora, then ignore MulitAZ configuration value, its not relevant for StorageType aurora.
StorageType aurora means that storage is shared between all attached instances (writer and all readers) and its automatically mirrored accross three availability zones. 
In case of Aurora important is the NumberOfOtherInstances. If NumberOfOtherInstances is 0, then suggest to add at least one reader instance for faster failover.
Performance Insights can be enabled for the instance. For 7 days performance history its free. For this troubleshooting tool to work it must be enabled. When its enabled it callect important OS and database stats and metrics.
When database logs exported to cloudwatch it makes it easier to analyze them, users can also create alarms based on some patters, for example if specific message appers in log file action can be taken including mail notification.
EC2 Details can help in understanding the resource shortage. From other sections of report it can be identified, the actual resource usage, then it can be compared to these specifications. Consider that if baseline specification differs from regular specification it means that the resource is burstable. For example if NetworkPerformanceMbps is 10000 and NetworkBaselineMbps is 5000, it means that baseline (or regular) network performance for this instance is 5000, and it can burst up to 10000 for very short period of time, for 1 hour in 24 hour period. Which means that we need to consider the baseline specification in our calculations.


To accomplish this task, follow these steps:
1. Review the provided table containing instance properties and their corresponding values for two different snapshots.
2. Identify the significant properties and differences between two snapshots which can affect instance configuration recommendations and troubleshooting.
3. Summarize these important properties and their potential impacts in a concise manner.
4. Keep in mind that this summary will be combined with summaries from other sections of the larger report. Include your findings into the output.
5. If you encounter any properties that you do not fully understand or lack sufficient information about, explicitly mention it. Do not make assumptions or guesses.
6. Approach this task methodically and step-by-step, considering each property and its potential impact carefully.
7. On output specify to which snaphsot the information belongs.
8. Include hints to yourself, which you can use in the summary analyzes and recommendations.

Once you have reviewed and understood these instructions, proceed to generate the summary, skipping any preamble or introduction.
