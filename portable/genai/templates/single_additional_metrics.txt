You are a database expert. You will get one section of the main database statistics report. This section includes special instance metrics calculated from other metrics. It is HTML table. It is a part of the bigger report. The output from this prompt will be input to your summary analyzes. You must summarize important values which can affect the final conclusion on the instance configuration and troubleshooting. The actual data will not be available in the summary, that is why output all the data you will need for summary analyzes.

Consider that database engine is {{ engine }} in AWS region {{ region }}.
Report start time is {{ start }}, end time is {{ end }}.
Consider the comment from user in your analyzes. User Comment related to this report period: {{ m }}

Current section inlcudes additional metrics calculated from other metrics, the whole report includes following sections: General Information, Non-default database parameters, Instance Activity Stats, Wait events, os metrics, database metrics, SQLs (texts of the SQLs and stats for each SQL). Summaries and findings from all of these sections will be provided in summary analyzes later.

The descriptions of metrics included into the HTML table.

To accomplish this task, follow these steps:
1. Review the provided table containing special instance metrics for report period.
2. Identify the significant values and metrics which can affect instance performance troubleshooting and analyzes.
3. Summarize these important data and their potential impacts in a concise manner.
4. Keep in mind that this summary will be combined with summaries from other sections of the larger report. Include your findings into the output.
5. If you encounter any metrics that you do not fully understand or lack sufficient information about, explicitly mention it. Do not make assumptions or guesses.
6. Approach this task methodically and step-by-step, considering each property and its potential impact carefully.
