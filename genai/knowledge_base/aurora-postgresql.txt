Misc:
tup_returned: Represents data fetched from both sequential and index scans (bitmap index scans). A high value could indicate inefficient queries or a high number of full table scans.
tup_fetched: Represents data fetched specifically from index scans (bitmap index scans). A high value relative to tup_returned could suggest suboptimal indexing or query plans.
db.SQL.logical_reads: Total number of blocks read from both cache and disk.

Aurora PostgreSQL has two types of instances: 1) Provisioned one, when DBInstanceClass is set to specific provisioned EC2 instance class; 2) Serverless deployment when DBInstanceClass is set to "db.serverless".
Aurora Serverless is an on-demand, auto-scaling configuration for Amazon Aurora that automatically adjusts database capacity based on application demand. Here's an overview of how Aurora Serverless works:
    Scalability:
        Scales continuously and rapidly in fine-grained increments
        Can handle hundreds of thousands of transactions in a fraction of a second
        Scales from as low as 0.5 Aurora Capacity Units (ACUs) up to 128 ACUs
    Capacity Management:
        You specify a minimum and maximum capacity range for your cluster
        Aurora automatically adjusts capacity within this range based on workload
        Eliminates the need for manual capacity planning and management
    Use Cases:
        Ideal for variable and unpredictable workloads
        Well-suited for multi-tenant applications, development/testing, and new applications
Aurora Serverless simplifies database management by automating capacity adjustments, potentially reducing operational overhead and costs while maintaining the performance and reliability expected from Aurora databases.

Summary of the key points about tuning Aurora PostgreSQL:
- In case of Aurora, ignore Mulit-AZ configuration value, its not relevant for Aurora. If Aurora has read only instances in different region, then it is a great high availability solution for fast failover.
- When you consider the wait events, always make attention on the impact of this event (the percent from DB Time). Even if wait event exists, it doesnt mean that it has negative effect. It can have very low impact. For example if IPC:BufferIO: 0.45% of DB time, then it is very low impact event, or if IPC:ExecuteGather: 0.05% of DB time, then it is negligibly low impact and can be ignored.
- Alsways consider the resource limits of the instance and actual usage, hitting the resource limits is an issue which needs very high attention.
- Consider that one of the most widely detected problems is a missing or stale table or index statistics. It can lead to inefficient execution plans or access paths. Always add recommendations to analyze the objects and gather fresh statistics.
- Always check the number of executions in different snapshots; it can help identify if the problem could be just a high number of executions and not problems with query optimizations.
- Consider that optimizer stats can be stale if the query behaves differently on an approximately similar number of executions, along with missing or incorrect index usage.
- Understanding wait events is crucial, as they indicate when a session is waiting on resources like locks, disk I/O, log writes, etc. High wait times typically signal performance issues.
- Aurora PostgreSQL memory is divided into shared memory areas like the buffer pool for caching data pages, WAL buffers for transaction logs; and local memory areas for each backend process like work memory for sorts/hashes, temp buffers, etc. Sizing these areas properly is important.
- Aurora uses multiple processes - the postmaster process forks backend processes for client connections and background processes like the WAL writer, background writer, autovacuum, etc.
- The shared buffer pool caches data pages in memory to reduce disk I/O. Proper sizing of shared_buffers is critical.
- Work memory areas are used for sorts, hashes, index creation, etc. Setting work_mem appropriately prevents excessive disk spilling.
- WAL logging is key for recovery and reducing disk I/O. Setting wal_level controls how much is logged.
- Autovacuum automates vacuum/analyze to reclaim space and update stats. But it can cause I/O spikes if not tuned well.
- Consider that CPU in wait events doesnt mean that processes was waiting for CPU resources, it means that processes was on CPU, actively using CPU doing their job.

### Primary Metrics to Check (in order of importance)
1. **ACUUtilization** - % of max ACU capacity used
   - →100% = instance hit max ACU limit, needs higher max setting
2. **CPUUtilization** - % of CPU used relative to max ACU
   - High value = CPU-driven scaling (queries, computations)
3. **FreeableMemory** - Available memory at max capacity
   - →0 = memory-driven scaling (buffer pool, connections, temp operations)
4. **ServerlessDatabaseCapacity** - Current ACU count
   - Track actual consumption over time
5. **TempStorageIOPS / TempStorageThroughput** - Local storage activity
   - Rare cause: temp table operations, sorts spilling to disk
### Secondary Metrics (Network-related)
- `NetworkReceiveThroughput` / `NetworkTransmitThroughput`
- `StorageNetworkThroughput`
### Features That Increase Baseline ACU (prevent scale-down)
- Performance Insights (min 2 ACU recommended)
- Aurora Global Database (min 8 ACU for primary region)
- CloudWatch Logs export
- `pg_audit` enabled
- Enhanced Monitoring
- Reader instances in promotion tier 0/1 (scale with writer)
### Parameters That Prevent Scale-Down
- `max_connections` above default
- `max_locks_per_transaction` above default
- Any shared memory parameters set higher than default
### Performance Insights Counters
- `os.general.serverlessDatabaseCapacity` - current ACUs
- `os.general.acuUtilization` - % of max
- `os.general.maxConfiguredAcu` / `os.general.minConfiguredAcu`
### Quick Decision Tree
```
ACUUtilization=100%? → Max ACU limit reached
CPUUtilization high? → CPU-bound workload
FreeableMemory→0?    → Memory pressure
TempStorage high?    → Disk spill operations
None of above?       → Check enabled features/parameters
